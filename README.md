# machineLearning_assignments
These are the assignments that I was told to complete in my Machine Learning course at my school, specifically CS 171 at the University of California, Riverside. The files included are python Jupyter notebooks. In each file, there is a prompt explaining the assignment and my code for that assignment.

The .m file is a machine learning project written in Matlab. The four .txt files and the .pdf file accompany only this project, not the python Jupyter notebook assignments.
